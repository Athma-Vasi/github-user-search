# Github User Search App

This is a simple app that allows you to search for users on Github. It uses the Github API (using octokit) to fetch the user and display their publicly available information, such as their name, bio, location, and avatar, followers, and following count. There is also a theme toggle button that allows you to switch between light and dark mode.

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6).

**Here is the challenge brief**

Your challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using the GitHub users API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
